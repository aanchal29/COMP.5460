Computer Graphics I -- Programming Assignment 2: Still 2D Drawing

This is still in 2D. You will need to implement your Exam 1 answers (here's a slightly modified version of the exam), with some additional features.

REMEMBER: You lose IMMEDIATELY 50% of your points if you do not follow submission and formatting instructions EXACTLY. Further: if we cannot conveniently find and test your submissions we'll just move on to the next person (and you'll lose ALL points).

Your assignment is:

1.  [35 points] Implement question 1 of Exam 1
2.  [35 points] Implement question 2 of Exam 1
3.  [20 points] Add some attribute controls to both. By attributes I mean the ability to change any of color, style, thickness, fill pattern, and the like.
4.  [10 points] Impress me: do something else, something exciting, creative ... you know.
