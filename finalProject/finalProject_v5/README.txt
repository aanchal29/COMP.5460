This Week I implemented the following Pages:
-----------
Page 1: Texture Mapping
I am using Detecter JS for this. I am drawing the picture on canvas and later the picture is reflected on to the sides of the cube. Check out the online demo at http://www.cs.uml.edu/~asharma/427546s2018/finalProject/finalProject_v5/textureMapping.html.

Page 2: Shadow Mapping
I created two light bulbs, one cylinder, one pyramid, one cube and one sphere. The sphere, pyramid and light bulbs are static, they don’t change their position. Whereas the cylinder and cube moves. And the shadow can be seen on the surface. Check out the online demo at http://www.cs.uml.edu/~asharma/427546s2018/finalProject/finalProject_v5/shadowMapping.html

Page 3: pa2.html
In order to get familiar with lighting which is also fundamental to creating any scene, using WebG, this is the best page to visit. In this assignment, I’m writing some code to help me understand on how the lighting equations work. Check out the online demo at http://www.cs.uml.edu/~asharma/427546s2018/finalProject/finalProject_v5/pa2.html

Page 4: BatMan.html

This is for extra credit. I hope you enjoy it! Check out the online demo at http://www.cs.uml.edu/~asharma/427546s2018/finalProject/finalProject_v5/batman.html

P.S. WebGL runs within the browser, so is independent of the operating andwindow systems. You may finish the assignment using any operating system you like, e.g. Windows, OSX or Linux. Programming language: The assignment will be implemented in JavaScript.
