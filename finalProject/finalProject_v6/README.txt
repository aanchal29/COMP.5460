I gave a switch to explore the city using two camera modes i.e. ArcBall View and Drive View. Below are the screenshots of different views. Here, I am giving only two views as I found only these two views which go in sync with the requirement. In case you want to explore more about the camera views, please refer the Week 4 submission. Also, You can see the total canvas area by clicking at the “SeeCanvasArea” checkbox.
