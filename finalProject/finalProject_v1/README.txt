For now, Iâ€™ve added only the front view of my dream house.

For Javascript, I used the jQuery library. And for CSS styling, I used some bootstrap. With jQuery helped me to change the website color and also helped to merge multiple mouse events and functions with ease.

I have svgs in html for the front view and rear view of my dream house. I have some global parameters to perform translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing. Everytime the function is called, it uses to jqery and the css function is used to display the effects. I also have a reset option. 

Since, there is no benchmark set. So for now I am just submitting the proper functionality for front view and rear view. I am yet to work on other two views.
