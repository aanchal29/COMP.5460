This Week I implemented the following Pages:
-----------
Page 1: Periodic Table
Check out the online demo at http://www.cs.uml.edu/~asharma/427546s2018/finalProject/finalProject_v4/periodicTable.html. The script files used here are: three.js, tween.min.js, TrackballControls.js and  CSS3DRenderer.js

Page 2 3D Animation Lines for animated background color
I took a prebuild three.js [example](http://threejs.org/examples/#canvas_lines) and put a fancy animated background color, adjusted some parameters like number of lines, perspective and colors. Now is ready to use for everyone. Check out the online demo at http://www.cs.uml.edu/~asharma/427546s2018/finalProject/finalProject_v4/3DAnimationLines.html

Page 3: Basic Camera Movement using three.js and WebGL

The JS file used for for the understanding of the Basics of Camera Movement is Detector.js and three.min.js files. The Tags used in creation of this webpage are:  HTML5, javascript, canvas, three.js, animation, camera. I gave the drop-down at the top right to switch between tilt, pan, zoom, pedestal, dolly and truck/track.
